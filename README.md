## How to install

There are three ways to install.

### Stable channel of JetBrains Plugins Repository

1. Open Settings(Windows, Linux) / Preferences(macOS)... | Plugins
1. Search "Mob" and install

### EAP channel of JetBrains Plugins Repository

Alpha, Beta, and RC versions will only be released on EAP channel.

1. Open Settings(Windows, Linux) / Preferences(macOS)... | Plugins | :gear: | Manage Plugin Repositories...
1. Add `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list`
1. Search "Mob" and install

### Download from plugin page

1. Open [Mob - plugin for IntelliJ IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14266-mob) page and download latest zip file
1. Open Settings(Windows, Linux) / Preferences(macOS)... | Plugins | :gear: | Install Plugin from Disk...
1. Select downloaded zip file to install plugin


## How to use

Git | Mob | Start Mob Programming as Typist... (shortcut: ALT+M, S)

![menu](documents/menu.png)

![start dialog](documents/start.png)

Click OK, so switched to a separate branch. Start mob programming!

When handover to the next person,

Git | Mob | Next : Handover to Next Typist... (shortcut: ALT+M, N)

![next dialog](documents/next.png)

Continue with "Start" and handover to the next person with "Next".
Continue with "Start" and handover to the next person with "Next".
Continue with "Start" and handover to the next person with "Next".
...

When you're done,

Git | Mob | Done : Finish Mob Session... (shortcut: ALT+M, D)

After confirm in a dialog,
get your changes into the staging area of the `master` branch. 
Please commit & push into base branch yourself.


## How does it work

- Start Mob Programming as Typist : creates branch `mob-session` and pulls from `origin/mob-session`
- Next : pushes all changes to `origin/mob-session`in a `mob next [ci-skip]` commit
- Done : squashes all changes in `mob-session` into staging of `master` and removes `mob-session` and `origin/mob-session`
- Set "Timer" in start dialog : start a specific minute timer, notify by a balloon if expired
- Select "Also activates screenshare in Zoom" in start dialog : start screen sharing in Zoom (requires Zoom configuration)
- Select "Stay in WIP branch after executing 'Next' and checkout base branch" in next dialog : after handover code, stay on mob session branch
- Resets Any Unfinished Mob Session : deletes `mob-session` and `origin/mob-session`

### Zoom Screen Share Integration

The "Also activates screenshare in Zoom" feature uses the Zoom keyboard shortcut "Start/Stop Screen Sharing". This only works if you

- make the shortcut globally available (Zoom > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts), and
- keep the default shortcut at CMD+SHIFT+S (macOS)/ ALT+S (Windows, Linux).
- setting under System Preferences required on macOS Catalina (or later?); Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Accessibility, and add your IntelliJ Platform Based IDEs .app

## How to configure

Open Settings(Windows, Linux) / Preferences(macOS) | Tools | Mob

![preferences](documents/preferences.png)

Settings are saves to `.idea/mob.xml`.

If you want a voice notification when the timer expires,
open Notifications settings and turn on "Read aloud" on "Mob Timer" row (macOS only).

![notification settings](documents/preferences_notification.png)

There are two ways to open Notification settings.

- Preferences... | Appearance & Behavior | Notifications
- Event Log window | :wrench:


## Troubleshoot

To see `idea.log`, in JetBrains Toolbox, open Settings | Configuration, and click "Show logs directory" button.

If necessary, get the trace level log.
Open Help | Diagnostic Tools | Debug Log Settingsâ€¦, and input `#com.nowsprinting.intellij-mob:trace`.


## Milestones

### 1.1

- Good looking timer widget on statusbar
- Pause/resume timer action launch from statusbar

### 1.x

- Integration tests
- Refactor: dialogs uses `DialogWrapper`
- Refactor: tests about `GitRepository`
- Input validation on dialogs
- Support multiple repository
- Can rollback on "done" by splitting the done process into two phases
